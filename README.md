# 🚀 About this project

This repository contains a Pokedex project.

The Pokedex is an application which the user can view a list of Pokemons.

To get the Pokemons data it was used the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

This project will be used to learn how create a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application using the tooling [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

Also I will use this repository to improve my knowledge related to [React](https://reactjs.org/) and its ecosystem, for example, the test stack, state management, etc.

## 🛠 Tech stack

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) to create the component styles
